# BodyVision
This application utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze images and provide accurate 3D measurements of objects within them.

# Features
1--> Image Capture: Capture or upload images containing objects or scenes to be measured.

2--> Object Detection: Identify and locate objects of interest within the image using advanced object detection algorithms.

3--> Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features such as key points, edges, and contours to understand the shape and structure of the objects.

4--> Depth Estimation: Utilize depth estimation techniques to calculate the distance between different parts of the object or scene.

5--> Dimension Calculation: Calculate dimensions in three dimensions (length, width, and height) based on the depth information and known scale of the scene.

6--> Display and Interaction: Provide a user-friendly interface for displaying measurements, allowing users to interact with the measurements and annotate the image.

7--> Accuracy and Calibration: Include calibration steps to ensure accuracy, accounting for camera distortions, lens characteristics, and other factors. Provide feedback on the confidence level of the measurements.
